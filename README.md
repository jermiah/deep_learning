### **1. Speaker Recognition and Classification**

#### **Summary**
This project classifies speakers based on their voice recordings. It involves extracting features from audio (MFCCs), feeding them into deep learning models, and identifying which speaker is speaking.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** Audio recordings from multiple speakers.
- **Methods:**
  - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) feature extraction using `torchaudio`.
  - Sequence modeling using deep neural networks (MLP, LSTM, or CNN).
- **Evaluation:** Classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and training loss curves.

### **2. Sentiment Classification with BERT**

#### **Summary**
This NLP project uses BERT for fine-tuned sentiment classification. It predicts the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of given text input using Transformer-based embeddings.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** Text dataset labeled with sentiment classes.
- **Methods:**
  - HuggingFace Transformers (`bert-base-uncased`)
  - Tokenization and attention masks
  - Fine-tuning the BERT model on sentiment data
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall metrics, confusion matrix.

### **3. Image Classification via Transfer Learning**

#### **Summary**
This computer vision project uses transfer learning with pretrained CNNs (like ResNet or VGG) for classifying images into different categories. It reduces training time while achieving strong performance.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** A folder-based image dataset with labels.
- **Methods:**
  - Pretrained CNN (e.g., ResNet18) from `torchvision.models`
  - Data augmentation using transforms
  - Fine-tuning last layers on custom dataset
- **Evaluation:** Training accuracy, validation accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations.
