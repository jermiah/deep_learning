### **1. Speaker Recognition and Classification**

#### **Summary**
This project identifies speakers using audio recordings by leveraging pretrained ECAPA-TDNN embeddings from the SpeechBrain library. It explores both classification and similarity-based approaches to speaker recognition, and includes a Gradio demo app for interactive testing. Designed using a small sample dataset, this project showcases a lightweight hybrid speaker recognition pipeline.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** Small-scale speaker dataset with short audio clips representing multiple identities.
- **Methods:**
  - **Preprocessing:** Mono conversion, resampling to 16 kHz, and fixed-length waveform padding using `torchaudio`.
  - **Embedding Extraction:** ECAPA-TDNN model from `speechbrain.pretrained.EncoderClassifier`.
  - **Two Approaches:**
    -  **Classification-based**: A custom neural network (`EmbeddingClassifierBN`) trained on embeddings for multi-class speaker identification.
    -  **Similarity-based**: Cosine similarity between embeddings to verify if two audio clips are from the same speaker.
  - **Hybrid Evaluation:** Combines both approaches for flexible inference and robustness testing.
- **Interface:** A user-friendly **Gradio app** allows real-time testing of speaker audio to evaluate both classification and similarity predictions.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, training loss curves, confusion matrices, and real-world inference via the Gradio interface.

### **2. Sentiment Classification with BERT**

#### **Summary**
This NLP project uses BERT for fine-tuned sentiment classification. It predicts the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of given text input using Transformer-based embeddings.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** Text dataset labeled with sentiment classes.
- **Methods:**
  - HuggingFace Transformers (`bert-base-uncased`)
  - Tokenization and attention masks
  - Fine-tuning the BERT model on sentiment data
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall metrics, confusion matrix.

### **3. Image Classification via Transfer Learning**

#### **Summary**
This computer vision project uses transfer learning with pretrained CNNs (like ResNet or VGG) for classifying images into different categories. It reduces training time while achieving strong performance.

#### **Highlights**
- **Data:** A folder-based image dataset with labels.
- **Methods:**
  - Pretrained CNN (e.g., ResNet18) from `torchvision.models`
  - Data augmentation using transforms
  - Fine-tuning last layers on custom dataset
- **Evaluation:** Training accuracy, validation accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations.
